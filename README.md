# PageDownloader

## Overview
This is a quick python script to create a large screenshot of any webpage provided the url. It will keep going until a forced stop (ctrl+c) for downloading segments of the page, as the original purpose of the script was to scan certain textbook websites with free books for offline use.

In order to enhance the experience of some offline reading, people will often download content when permissable on the site (original use case). Creating multipage pdfs can be inconvienient for reading, as a result this provides a convienient alternative where one can simply fire the script on large chapters to create a single scrollable image for browsing.
